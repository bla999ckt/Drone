## Introduction to Pixhawk 6X

The Pixhawk 6X is an advanced flight controller that serves as the brain of your drone. It's designed to handle complex flight operations and can be programmed to perform autonomous missions.

### Key Features
- Advanced flight control algorithms
- GPS navigation
- Multiple flight modes
- Telemetry capabilities
- Mission planning support

## Required Hardware

1. **Pixhawk 6X Flight Controller**
2. **GPS Module** (usually comes with Pixhawk)
3. **Telemetry Radio** (for ground control communication)
4. **Power Distribution Board**
5. **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)**
6. **Motors**
7. **Propellers**
8. **Battery**
9. **Frame**
10. **RC Receiver** (for manual control backup)

## Software Setup

### 1. Install Required Software
- **QGroundControl**: Main ground control station software
  - Download from: https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html
- **Mission Planner**: Alternative ground control station
  - Download from: https://ardupilot.org/planner/

### 2. Basic Configuration Steps
1. Connect Pixhawk to computer via USB
2. Open QGroundControl
3. Follow the setup wizard to:
   - Calibrate sensors
   - Configure flight modes
   - Set up failsafe procedures
   - Configure GPS

## Basic Drone Programming

### 1. Understanding Flight Modes
- **Stabilize**: Basic flight mode for manual control
- **Loiter**: Maintains position using GPS
- **RTL**: Return to Launch
- **Auto**: Follows pre-programmed mission
- **Guided**: Follows commands from ground control

### 2. Creating a Basic Mission
1. Open QGroundControl
2. Go to Plan view
3. Add waypoints by clicking on the map
4. Set actions for each waypoint:
   - Take off
   - Change altitude
   - Land
   - Wait
   - etc.

### 3. Basic Python Code Example
```python
from pymavlink import mavutil

# Connect to the drone
master = mavutil.mavlink_connection('udpin:localhost:14550')

# Wait for the first heartbeat
master.wait_heartbeat()

# Set mode to GUIDED
master.mav.command_long_send(
    master.target_system,
    master.target_component,
    mavutil.mavlink.MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MODE,
    0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

# Arm the drone
master.mav.command_long_send(
    master.target_system,
    master.target_component,
    mavutil.mavlink.MAV_CMD_COMPONENT_ARM_DISARM,
    0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

## Integration with Blood Delivery System

### 1. Connecting to Flask Application
The drone controller in our Flask application (`drone_controller.py`) uses the MAVLink protocol to communicate with the Pixhawk. Here's how it works:

1. **Install Required Python Packages**:
```bash
pip install pymavlink dronekit
```

2. **Basic Drone Controller Setup**:
```python
from dronekit import connect, VehicleMode, LocationGlobalRelative

class DroneController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vehicle = None
        
    def connect(self):
        # Connect to the drone
        self.vehicle = connect('udpin:localhost:14550', wait_ready=True)
        return True
        
    def arm_and_takeoff(self, target_altitude=10):
        # Basic takeoff sequence
        self.vehicle.mode = VehicleMode("GUIDED")
        self.vehicle.armed = True
        self.vehicle.simple_takeoff(target_altitude)
        return True
```

### 2. Mission Planning
1. Create waypoints for each hospital
2. Set up geofencing for safety
3. Implement failsafe procedures
4. Add payload management (blood container)

### 3. Safety Features
- Return-to-Launch on low battery
- Geofencing to prevent flying in restricted areas
- Emergency landing procedures
- Weather condition monitoring

## Safety Considerations

### 1. Pre-flight Checklist
- Battery level check
- GPS signal strength
- Weather conditions
- Propeller inspection
- Payload securement

### 2. Emergency Procedures
- Manual override capability
- Emergency landing zones
- Backup power systems
- Communication redundancy

### 3. Legal Requirements
- Register your drone with aviation authorities
- Obtain necessary permits
- Follow local drone regulations
- Maintain flight logs

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Basic Setup**:
   - Assemble the drone
   - Install and configure QGroundControl
   - Perform basic flight tests

2. **Learn Basic Programming**:
   - Study the MAVLink protocol
   - Practice with simple missions
   - Understand flight modes

3. **Integration**:
